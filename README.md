FlappyArduino
=============

I made this game in around an hour time span during the Fall 2014 PennApps, while taking a break!

I had never worked with Arduinos before, so I wanted to capitalize on the opportunity I had with the Intel Galileo to try to make something small.

The result is a fairly simple obstacle-avoiding game that loops perpetually. A fun time-waster, to say the least - if you don't mind the lack of graphical complexity.
